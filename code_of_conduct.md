# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Standards
We pledge as a community to hold ourselves and our peers accountable for upholding high standards for how we treat others. The Electricity Maps contributors community strives to find success in our projects and personal goals by uplifting and empowering each other **regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.** [1] 

To uphold this code of conduct we will prioritize the following values:
1. Treat ourselves and others with respect and dignity at all times
2. Strive to uplift each contributor to achieve their goals and grow as contributors/developers
3. Provide a safe and inviting space for all questions and inquiries 
4. Seek out less experienced developers to offer assistance 

## Our People
